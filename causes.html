        <h1>Causes and Threats</h1>
        <p class="textContent">In the digital age, a multitude of cyber threats pose significant risks to individuals and organizations worldwide. Phishing attacks, for instance, remain rampant, with over 220,000 unique phishing websites detected in just the first quarter of 2021, according to the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG). These deceptive schemes lure users into divulging sensitive information by impersonating trustworthy entities.</p>
        <p class="textContent">Another pressing cyber threat is the prevalence of malware. Malicious software, including viruses, ransomware, and spyware, can infiltrate your devices, compromising your personal data and system security. Cybercriminals often employ sophisticated techniques to distribute malware, such as embedding malicious code in seemingly harmless downloads or email attachments. Once your device is infected, it can lead to data loss, financial fraud, and even the hijacking of your computer or smartphone for criminal activities.</p>
        <p class="textContent">Hacking remains a significant threat to digital security. Skilled hackers target vulnerable systems to gain unauthorized access, potentially causing severe damage. Large-scale data breaches, where sensitive information of millions is exposed, are often orchestrated by cybercriminals. These breaches can have far-reaching consequences, from identity theft to financial losses and reputational damage. It's crucial for individuals and organizations to implement robust security measures to defend against hacking attempts and safeguard sensitive data.</p>

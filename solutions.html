        <h1>Data Protection Solutions and Tips</h1>
        <ol class="textContent">
            <li>
                Use Strong, Unique Passwords
                <p class="bulletContent">Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long and include a mix of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common phrases. Consider using a trusted password manager to generate, store, and autofill complex passwords for different accounts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
                <p class="bulletContent">Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to provide a second form of verification, typically a code sent to your mobile device or email. Enable 2FA wherever possible, especially for your email, social media, and financial accounts. Use authenticator apps or hardware tokens for added security.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Regularly Update Software and Apps
                <p class="bulletContent">Keep your operating system, applications, and antivirus software up to date to patch security vulnerabilities. Configure automatic updates whenever possible to ensure you're protected against the latest threats. Enable automatic updates for your web browser to receive security fixes promptly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Secure Browsing Habits
                <p class="bulletContent">Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading files from unfamiliar websites or email attachments. Use web browsers with built-in security features and consider installing browser extensions like ad blockers and script blockers. Always ensure websites you visit use HTTPS encryption, especially for online transactions and sensitive activities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Protect Personal Information
                <p class="bulletContent">Limit the personal information you share online, especially on social media platforms. Adjust privacy settings on social media accounts to control who can see your posts and personal information. Be wary of friend requests or messages from unknown individuals on social media.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Educate About Phishing Awareness
                <p class="bulletContent">Learn to recognize phishing attempts by examining the sender's email address and looking out for misspellings or unusual requests. Never click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown sources. If you receive a suspicious email, report it to your email provider and delete it immediately.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Backup Data Regularly
                <p class="bulletContent">Create regular backups of important files and data to an external hard drive or a secure cloud storage service. Test your backups periodically to ensure they are functioning correctly and can be restored if needed. In the event of a cyberattack or data loss, having up-to-date backups can prevent permanent data loss.</p>
